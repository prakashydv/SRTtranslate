1
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:10,648
That was probably

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,561
our second-best
potato chip war ever.

3
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:17,996
What the hell ?!

4
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:21,973
We'll clean it
up later, dude.

5
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:26,482
I'm not your "dude," and
you never clean anything up.

6
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:31,508
Well, we mean to, but then we leave, and then
we come back, and it's already cleaned up.

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,014
You eat my food,
you dirty up my house

8
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:38,939
and every time I
go into a bedroom,

9
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:42,913
I have to wonder about finding one
of you naked with some poor girl !

10
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:47,650
Well, at least you know that if you
find me naked in a room, I'm by myself.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,782
All right, I want everybody who doesn't
live in this house to get out now !

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,003
You know what ? You're
a real bummer, man.

13
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,587
Come on, fez, let's
go to our new apartment

14
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:04,460
where people can do whatever
they want, whenever they want.

15
00:01:04,484 --> 00:01:06,465
Just like the bible says,

16
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:09,126
"let my people do
whatever they want."

17
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:11,536
eric,

18
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:18,263
the high school sent over your transcript, which
means you can start applying to teachers' college.

19
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:23,260
Now you tell me what school you wanna
go to, and I will send them a pie.

20
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:28,788
Because you cannot eat a lady's pie and
then not let her son into the school.
